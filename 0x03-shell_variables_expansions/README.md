# Shell, init files, variables and expansions
		

		
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about alias builtin, help builtin, local, global and reserved variables (PATH, HOME and PS1), special parameters `$?` and single an double quotes in **Shell**.
		

		
## Technologies
		
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
		
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
		

		
## Files
		
All of the following files are scripts:

| `1-hello_you` | Prints `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user |
